# Solutions of LBB-Mendelics 2021 Challenge

This repo contains my solutions for the [LBB-Mendelics 2021 Challenge](https://github.com/mendelics/lbb-mendelics-2021). It's a 3 day challenge to show e check for users skills in bioinformatics, each day they released a new challenge:

- [Day 1: chromossome genotyping](https://github.com/rodtheo/rtrvar22/tree/main/Dia_1)
- [Day 2: quality check evaluation](https://github.com/rodtheo/rtrvar22/tree/main/Dia_2)
- Day 3: investigating sequence variants

**Disclaimer: this repo only has the solutions for Day 1 and Day 2. I didn't answer day's 3 challenge, therefore I was disqualified.**
